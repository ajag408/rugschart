## 🔗 Live Demo

[View Live Demo](https://rugschart.vercel.app/)

## 📝 Project Overview

The main focus was on enhancing the chart component with engaging animations, smooth transitions, and responsive design.

## 💡 Technical Migration

### Canvas to Chart.js Trade-off

**Original Canvas Implementation**

- Low-level drawing API with direct pixel manipulation
- Complete control over rendering and animations
- Manual handling of all chart behaviors
- Complex but highly customizable

**Current Chart.js Solution**

- High-level, declarative API
- Built-in handling of animations, scaling, and responsiveness
- Plugin system for extended functionality
- Faster development and better maintainability

This migration prioritized development efficiency and maintainability while retaining the ability to create custom animations and effects.

## 🎯 Key Features

### Interactive Chart Component

- Real-time price movement visualization
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Dynamic color changes based on price movement
- Responsive scaling and adaptable viewport

### Visual Effects & Animations

- "To The Moon" celebration effect with animated rocket and stars
- Rug pull shake animation with color transitions
- Dynamic background gradient changes
- Countdown pulse animation
- Smooth candle transitions

### Technical Implementation

- Built with React + TypeScript + Vite
- Chart.js integration with custom configurations
- CSS animations and keyframes
- Responsive design principles
- Performance optimized animations using requestAnimationFrame

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- React 19.1.0
- TypeScript
- Chart.js 4.4.9
- chartjs-plugin-annotation 3.1.0
- Vite 6.3.5
